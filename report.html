          If the duct is laying on the ground, it creates a flat spot at the
          bottom which distorts the concentric insulation, and it distorts the
          tube inside, which in turn distorts the airflow and makes the system
          less efficient.

      <h1>P.S.</h1>
      <p class="hey">
        It is common and preferable to have more than one system in a house.
        This is especially true when their are multiple levels in the home. This
        would result in having one furnace upstairs and one downstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is preferable because the system will heat better and more
        efficiently since air doesn't have to travel so far to heat the entire
        home. Also, if one fails then you still have heat to one part of the
        house. Problems in general are easier to diagnose and isolate as either
        being downstais or upstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ductwork could likely be put underneath the house in the crawlspace.
        This would also be a fine place to put a furnace if there is adequate
        space to do so, and it has it's benefits, since ductwork coming from the
        furnace would be easier to install
      </p>
      <p>
        If you decided to put the furnace in the garage or closet, this would
        make the furnace easier to access for anyone servicing it in the future,
        but it would require holes to be drilled for the ductwork coming into
        the house, which could be problematic
      </p>
      <p>
        If you chose to put it in the crawlspace, the only necessary holes would
        be those in the floor for the actual vents themselves
      </p>
      <p>
        It is worth considering putting it next to the water heater, which is a
        common practice, since they could then share the gas line and flue.
        Running a new gas line and flue could be problematic
      </p>
